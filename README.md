# No Moments

> A chrome extension that hides the Moments button on the Twitter website.

This extension is distributed free of charge and made for educational/practical purposes only! No harm is intended toward the great nation of Twitter. I just don't want to accidentally click the button `Moments` button anymore, and I know a lot of other people who'd rather not deal with it too.

## Install

1. Download a `zip` from the releases section and unzip it on your local hard drive.
2. Open `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Make sure `Developer mode` is enabled.
4. Click `Load unpacked extension...` and select the directory where you unzipped this extension.

Presto! No Moments.
